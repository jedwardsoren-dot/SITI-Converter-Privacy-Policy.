    <h1>Privacy Policy – Ol Chiki → Roman Santali Converter</h1>

    <p>The Ol Chiki → Roman Santali Converter Chrome extension is designed solely to convert text from the Ol Chiki script into Roman Santali for easier reading and sharing. Your privacy is important to us, and this extension has been built to minimize data collection and protect your information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We do not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or browsing history. The extension processes only the text you choose to convert, and this is handled entirely in your browser unless you enable server-side conversion. In such cases, the selected text is sent securely via HTTPS to our controlled server, converted, and returned immediately without being stored or logged.</p>

    <h2>Storage of Preferences</h2>
    <p>To provide a consistent user experience, the extension may store your preferences — such as conversion mode, font display options, interface language, and allowed or blocked site lists — using Chrome’s local storage or sync features. This data remains under your control and can be cleared at any time within the extension’s settings.</p>

    <h2>No Tracking or Advertising</h2>
    <p>We do not use tracking pixels, analytics scripts, or advertising libraries. No data is shared with third parties for marketing or profiling purposes.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>All remote code updates or server interactions occur only over secure HTTPS connections. Remote code is served exclusively from our verified domain, with content integrity checks applied to ensure safety.</p>

    <h2>User Control</h2>
    <p>You may clear all stored preferences and optional history entries at any time using the extension’s built-in functions.</p>
